# ✅ Week 2: Singly Linked List in Python Using OOP

## 📌 Task Objective

Build a Python program to implement a **Singly Linked List** using **Object-Oriented Programming** (OOP).  
The program must:

- Create a `Node` class
- Create a `LinkedList` class
- Add nodes to the end of the list
- Print the entire list
- Delete the Nth node (1-based index)
- Handle edge cases (empty list, invalid index)

---

## 📁 File

- `Week 2: Singly Linked List with Deletion.py`

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Python classes and objects
- Data structures (Linked List)
- Exception handling
- Traversing and modifying node pointers

---

## 🧪 Sample Output

Linked List after insertion:
10 -> 20 -> 30 -> 40 -> 50 -> None

After deleting node at position 3:
10 -> 20 -> 40 -> 50 -> None

After deleting node at position 1:
20 -> 40 -> 50 -> None

After deleting node at position 10:
❌ Index out of range!

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python Week 2: Singly Linked List with Deletion.py
```

## 🛠️ Exception Handling
	•	❌ Deleting from an empty list
	•	❌ Deleting a node with an invalid index
	•	✅ Safe traversal with clear messages for users

⸻

## 📌 Summary

A clean, modular, and testable Python script that implements all required linked list operations with proper OOP structure and error handling.
